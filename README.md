Advent of Code 2018 Solution
==============================

My goals for the Advent of Code this year are to learn Haskell, and advance the Rholang ecosystem and community.

Haskell
-------
I'm considering haskell my main language for the problems this year. I will try to roughly keep pace with the problems in haskell.

Rholang
-------
I've learned a ton about rholang in the last few months and would like to see how serious of a language it can become. I'm already realizing it may not be realistic to solve the problems daily in rholang, but I do hope to complete them all.

By solving problems in rholang I hope to
1. Introduce new developers to rholang
2. Develop a standard library for rholang
3. Develop a deployment tool to manage dynamic linking

Javascript
----------
Javascript is one of my strongest languages, and I initially thought I would solve problems in js just to get the hang of them. After two days I'm finding it isn't worth the debugging time.

I will solve in js when I feel like it. I will probably also use js and rchain-api to supplement pure-rholang solutions when necessary.
